    "text": "Boltzmann–Lotka–Volterra Interaction Model\nThe model is based on Wilson’s maximum entropy spatial interaction models. Those models were designed in the late 60s to analyse trips or exchanges between origin locations and destination locations. In the BLV approach, one looks for an equilibrium state in which the attractiveness of the destination locations is proportional to the flow they receive.\n\nWilson’s maximal entropy production constrained model\nThis model computes flows between origin locations and destination locations using a maximum entropy principle. It uses the following data and parameters:\n\na cost matrix \\(c\\) of size \\(n\\times p\\): \\(c_{ij}\\) is the cost of having a “unitary” flow from origin location \\(i\\) to destination \\(j\\) (a classical choice it the distance between those locations)\na vector \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) that specifies the production constraints at the \\(n\\) origin locations\na vector \\(Z\\) of size \\(p\\) that specifies the attractivenesses of destination locations\na return to scale parameter \\(\\alpha\\) that enhance (or reduce if smaller that 1) the attractivenesses of destination locations when they are larger than 1\nthe inverse \\(\\beta\\) of a cost scale parameter, i.e., costs are multiplied by \\(\\beta\\) in the model\n\nIn Wilson’s model, the flow from origin location \\(i\\) to destination location \\(j\\), \\(Y_{ij}\\) is given by \\[\nY_{ij}=\\frac{X_iZ_j^{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\beta\nc_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^pZ_k^{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\beta c_{ik})}.\n\\] The model is production constrained because \\[\n\\forall i,\\quad X_i=\\sum_{j=1}^{p}Y_{ij},\n\\] that is the origin location \\(i\\) sends a total flow of exactly \\(X_i\\).\n\n\nBLV model\nThe core assumption of the BLV model is that the destination flows should be proportional to the attractivenesses. Given a flow matrix \\(Y\\), the destination flows are collected in a vector \\(D\\) of size p, with \\[\n\\forall j,\\quad D_j=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{ij}.\n\\] At equilibrium, we want \\[\n\\forall j,\\quad D_j=\\kappa Z_j,\n\\] for a given proportionality constant \\(\\kappa\\). To solve this fixed point equation in \\(Z\\), we iterate basic updates \\[\n\\forall j, Z_j^{t+1} = Z_j^{t} + \\epsilon (D^{t}_j-\\kappa Z^{t}_j),\n\\] using as small value for \\(\\epsilon\\) to avoid instabilities.\n\n\nBLV in archaeology\nThis approach has been quite successful in archaeology as seen in this selection of papers:\n\nSpatial Interaction and Structural Models in Historical Analysis\nModels of settlement hierarchy based on partial evidence\nApplication of an entropy maximizing and dynamics model for understanding settlement structure\nEvolving settlement patterns, spatial interaction and the socio-political organisation of late Prepalatial south-central Crete\nWas Thebes Necessary? Contingency in Spatial Modeling\n\nThe main strength of the model is that it relies only on distances or travel costs between locations, making it very relevant for ancient mobility when material evidence is scarce. When we have only costs (the \\(c\\) matrix), we generally initialise the BLV model with unitary attractivenesses (and productions). This can be refined using for instance the estimated area of locations.\nIn my research work, using BLV models is the natural next step after evaluating carefully travel costs with the method presented in my recent paper with Clara Filet: On the roads and rivers of Late Iron Age Gaul: Adjusting least-cost path analysis to multiple means of transport and imprecise data."

The node can then be queried with a collection of new functions to get information (such as the conditional distribution associated to the context) and to navigate the context tree (extending the context or truncating it)."

By default, the package still uses the former R implementation but a new option mixvlmc.backend can be used to switch to the C++ implementation. COVLMC do not benefit yet from this new implementation and it is therefore considered as experimental."

    "section": "Likelihood calculation",
    "text": "Likelihood calculation\nA minor issue with Markov model is the definition of the likelihood function. Given a finite time series \\((x_i)_{1\\leq i\\leq n}\\), we cannot compute the conditional probability of say \\(x_1\\) as we did not observe \\(x_0\\) (for a simple Markov chain of order 1). In general, we use a form of truncated likelihood in the sense that we exclude the first few observations from the calculation.\nIn the case of VLMC, this can be problematic as the number of excluded observations may well be of order \\(\\log n\\) for instance. Theoretical results show that this does not impair recoverability of the true model with e.g. the BIC, but this concerns only asymptotic behaviour. In addition, the practical use of VLMC for simulation or prediction emphasized the need for understanding how to handle the initial values that are not directly modelled.\nThe new version of mixvlmc addresses those aspects in a more principled manner and its documentation includes a lengthy discussion on likelihood functions and related matters in a vignette. This document owes a lot to discussions with my (former) colleagues Aurélien Garivier and Julien Stoehr. Many thanks to them!"
